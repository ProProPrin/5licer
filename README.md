A non-planar 5-axis slicer for FDM 3D printing. Deforms a mesh to eliminate overhangs, slices with a conventional slicer, then transforms the G-code back to the original geometry with rotation commands for a 5-axis printer.

**Note:** The original [S4 Slicer](https://github.com/jyjblrd/S4_Slicer) by Joshua Bird is fully functional. This fork is being adapted for 5-axis printing.
